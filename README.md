Online Digital Library for Universal Geography group

__________________________________

### What is this app ?
It servers as a portal to access Universal Geography Digital Library resources from mobile devices.
Note: The mobile app is currently under development.

### What platforms will it support ?
My current goal is to get it working completely, then try to get it on Google Play Store.
But we'll see how the distribution part works out ðŸ˜…

### A word of hope, caution and apology...
I truly hope that this app will help teachers access quality resources easily and for free.
You may check the releases section if you wish to try the app out (although it's still being developed rn, I'll try to get a release out soon).
Also, since I don't have any experience with mobile apps (hence the use of React Native), forgive my bad code. Also, any issues or PRs are welcome if you wish to contribute.
